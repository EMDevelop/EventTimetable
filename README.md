Hello Everybody!

This was my first ever project outside of Microsoft Excel, but the code works if you want to use it - created in 2018/19.

**What is it? **
In short: A mobile app which shows multiple stages/events occuring at the same time within a given project. The main application was for music festivals, for example Reading Festival, where there are 5/6 stages running at once, the app would show you which artists are clashing so you can plan your festival trip to perfection.

This is an Apple IOS Iphone app, built in Xcode (using Dart as the programming language), and it talks to a Firebase Database where the timings, event names and other information is stored. 

You could say the app functions like a Google Calander, but it just doesn't look as pretty :). 

The app functionally works, however I moved on to try and create this again in Flutter (cross platform mobile app development SDK). Please do use All or None of the project - and if anyone has any tips on how i could have done this better they are always welcome. 


**What will you need to run this?**
- up to date Xcode (I believe you need a Mac to operate but there might be work arounds). 
- A Firebase DB ( you can import the FirebaseEventData.json into your firebase account, and will need to modify the Google Service-info.plist, a file I have not uploaded)
- A willingness to read through poorly structured, beginner code. 

Thanks everyone!
